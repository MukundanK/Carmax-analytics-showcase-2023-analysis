# Carmax Analytics Showcase 2023

[CarMax analytics showcase](https://analyticsshowcase.carmax.com/) is an annual competition conducted by CarMax inviting analysts to leverage data to optimize their current strategies and recommend transformational business initiatives. 

This year's challenge statement:
"Many customers decide to trade-in their current vehicle when purchasing a vehicle at CarMax. What does a customer's appraised vehicle tell us about the vehicle they will end up purchasing? \
How can CarMax use this information to improve business operations and provide customers a personalized shopping experience?"

Participants are required to clean, analyze and synthesis their findings into a 1-page report and a 5-10 minute video. This repository contains my analysis of the carmax data and my [final report]().

This is the link to my 10 minute youtube video explaining my analysis: https://youtu.be/K8RWPu1k4bU
